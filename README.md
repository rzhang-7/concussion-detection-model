# Arduino Concussion Detection Model

This concussion detection model is a helmet prototype that analyzes forces applied to force sensors placed within the helmet and alerts users when they have received a potential concussion.

The protoype was built as part of a research project conducted as part of York University's k2i Work Integrated Learning program at the Lassonde School of Engineering.
